    <h2>WELCOME TO CODING CRUSH</h2>
   <h3>PL/SQL INTRODUCTION </h3>
<p>
    PL/SQL is a block structured language. The programs of PL/SQL are logical blocks
     that can contain any number of nested sub-blocks. Pl/SQL stands for "Procedural
      Language extension of SQL" that is used in Oracle. PL/SQL is integrated with Oracle
       database (since version 7). The functionalities of PL/SQL usually extended after 
       each release of Oracle database. Although PL/SQL is closely integrated with
     SQL language, yet it adds some programming constraints that are not available in SQL.

     <ul>
        <li>PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL).</li>
            <li>PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.</li>
           <li>Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements.</li>
           <li>PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. </li>
           <li>It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers.</li>
     </ul>
</p>
<h3>Features of PL/SQL:</h3>
<p>
    PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages. <br>
    PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command. <br>
    One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications. <br>
    PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling block. <br>
    Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is operational. <br>
    PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.

    <tr> 
     <td font size="6">SQL is a single query that is used to perform DML and DDL operations.</td>

    <tr>
        <td font size=" 6">It is declarative, that defines what needs to be done, rather than how things need to be done.</td>

        <td font size=" 6">Execute as a single statement.</td>

        <td font size=" 6">Mainly used to create an application.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td font size="6">Cannot contain PL/SQL code in it.</td>
        <td font size=" 6">It is an extension of SQL, so it can contain SQL inside it.</td>
