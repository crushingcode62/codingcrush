    <h2>WELCOME TO CODING CRUSH</h2>
   <h3>Constants</h3>
<p>  
    As the name implies a constant is a value used in a PL/SQL block that remains unchanged throughout the program. 
    A constant is a user-defined literal value. You can declare a constant and use it instead of actual value.
    For example: If you want to write a program which will increase the salary of the employees by 25%, you can 
    declare a constant and use it throughout the program. Next time when you want to increase the salary again you
     can change the value of the constant which will be easier than changing the actual value throughout the program.
    <br>   
    <br>
    The General Syntax to declare a constant is: <br>
    constant_name CONSTANT datatype:= VALUE;
    <br>
    In the syntax: constant_name is the name of the constant i.e. similar to a variable name.
The word CONSTANT is a reserved word and ensures that the value does not change.
VALUE - It is a value which must be assigned to a constant when it is declared. You cannot assign a value later.</p>
<br>
<h3>Variables : </h3>
   <p>Variables are placeholders (storage are(a) used to hold the data values that can change through the PL/SQL Block. Each variable in PL/SQL has a specific data type, who
     determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory and the set of
      operations that can be applied to the variable.</p>
<p>variables can be used for the following :
<br>    
    Temporary storage of data: Data can be temporarily stored in one or more variables for use when
     validating data input and for processing later in the data flow process <br>
     Manipulation of stored values: Variables can be used for calculations and other data . manipulations without accessing the database  <br>
    Reusability: After variables are declared, they can be used repeatedly in an application simply by referencing them in other
     statements, including other declarative statements. 
     <br>
    The name of a PL/SQL variable consists of a letter optionally followed by more letters, merals dollar signs, underscores, and number signs and should not exceed 30 characters default, variable names are not case-sensitive You cannot use a PL/SQL keyword as a variable name
    
    <b> Variable Declaration in PL/SQL </b>
    
    PL/SQL variables must be declared in the declaration section of PL/SQL block. When you declare a variable, PL/SQL allocates memory for the variable's value and the storage location is identified by the variable name.
    <br> 
    <br>
    The General Syntax to declare a variable is: 
    <br> variable name datatype [NOT NULL: = value];
    <br>
    In the syntax:
    variable_name is the name of the variable datatype is a valid PL/SQL datatype . NOT NULL is an optional specification on the variable
    . value or DEFAULT value is also an optional specification, where you can initialize a variable. <br>
    Each variable declaration is a separate statement and must be terminated by a semicolon.</p>
