   <h3>DATABASE</h3>
<p>
   <h4> What is Data?</h4>
    Data is a collection of a distinct small unit of information. It can be used in a variety of forms like text, numbers, media, bytes, etc. it can be stored in pieces of paper or electronic memory, etc.
    Word 'Data' is originated from the word 'datum' that means 'single piece of information.' It is plural of the word datum.
   In computing, Data is information that can be translated into a form for efficient movement and processing. Data is interchangeable.
   </p> 
    <h4>What is Database?</h4>
    <p>You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.
        Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users.
        The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.
       There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database.
       There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
        Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).
       SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. SQL depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
       A cylindrical structure is used to display the image of a database.

<h3> Advantage of DBMS</h3>
Controls redundancy
:It stores all the data in a single database file, so it can control data redundancy.
<br>Data sharing
:An authorized user can share the data among multiple users.
<br>Backup
:It providesBackup and recovery subsystem. This recovery system creates automatic data from system failure and restores data if required.
<br>Multiple user interfaces
:It provides a different type of user interfaces like GUI, application interfaces.
<br>
<h3> Disadvantage of DBMS</h3>
<br>Size
:It occupies large disk space and large memory to run efficiently.
<br>Cost
:DBMS requires a high-speed data processor and larger memory to run DBMS software, so it is costly.
<br> Complexity
:DBMS creates additional complexity and requirements.
