    <h2>WELCOME TO CODING CRUSH</h2>
  <h3>DATABASE USERS</h3>
<p>
   <b> What are DBMS Users?</b>
DBMS users generally access the database; it just specifies the different accounts associated with the user.
 This may require access for the user, and they are the ones who can take advantage of accessing the database and its data.
  In DBMS, we have different types of users who may have different types of access depending on the requirement. DBMS categorizes the users based on the access they have with the database. Sometimes it is required to order access for the database because they are particularly associated with the user id of the user and password. In the coming section of
 the tutorial, we will discuss more about the internal working and different types of users we have in DBMS in detail.
<br>
</p>
<h4>various users are :</h4>
<p>
   <b>Application Programmers </b>- They are the developers who interact with the database by means of DML queries. These
   DML queries are written in the application programs like C, C++, JAVA, Pascal etc.These queries are converted 
    object code to communicate with the database.
   <br> <b>Sophisticated Users </b>- They are database developers, who write SQL queries to select/insert/delete/update data.
     They do not use any application or programs to request the database. They directly interact with the database
      by means of query language like SQL. These users will be scientists, engineers, analysts who thoroughly study SQL
       and DBMS to apply the concepts in their requirement. In short, we can say this category includes designers and
        developers of DBMS and SQL.
        <br><b>Specialized Users </b>- These are also sophisticated users, but they write special database application programs.
 They are the developers who develop the complex programs to the requirement.
<br> <b>Native Users </b>- these are the users who use the existing application to interact with the database. 
For example, online library system, ticket booking systems, ATMs etc. which has existing application and users use them to interact with the database to fulfil their requests.
