    <h2>WELCOME TO CODING CRUSH</h2>
   <h3>FILE vs DBMS</h3>
<p><b>FILE SYSTEM:</b>File based systems were an early attempt to computerize the manual system. It is also called a traditional based approach in which a decentralized approach was taken
     where each department stored and controlled its own data with the help of a data processing specialist. The main role of a data processing specialist was to create the necessary computer file structures, and also 
    manage the data within structures and design some application programs that create reports based on file data.
  
</p>
<p><b>DBMS :</b>A database approach is a well-organized collection of data that are related in a meaningful way which can be accessed by different users but stored only once in a system.
     The various operations performed by the DBMS system are: Insertion, deletion, selection, sorting etc.
</p>

<table border="2">
    <tr>
    <th>Basis</th>
    <th>DBMS Approach</th>
    <th>File System Approach</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
    <td>DBMS is a collection of data. In DBMS, the user is not required to write the procedures.</td>
    <td>The file system is a collection of data. In this system, the user has to write the procedures for managing the database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Sharing of data</strong></td>
    <td>Due to the centralized approach, data sharing is easy.</td>
    <td>Data is distributed in many files, and it may be of different formats, so it isn't easy to share data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Data Abstraction</strong></td>
    <td>DBMS gives an abstract view of data that hides the details.</td>
    <td>The file system provides the detail of the data representation and storage of data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Security and Protection</strong></td>
    <td>DBMS provides a good protection mechanism.</td>
    <td>It isn't easy to protect a file under the file system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Recovery Mechanism</strong></td>
    <td>DBMS provides a crash recovery mechanism, i.e., DBMS protects the user from system failure.</td>
    <td>The file system doesn't have a crash mechanism, i.e., if the system crashes while entering some data, then the content of the file will be lost.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Concurrency Problems</strong></td>
    <td>DBMS takes care of Concurrent access of data using some form of locking.</td>
    <td>In the File system, concurrent access has many problems like redirecting the file while deleting some information or updating some information.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Cost</strong></td>
    <td>The database system is expensive to design.</td>
    <td>The file system approach is cheaper to design.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Data Redundancy and Inconsistency</strong></td>
    <td>Due to the centralization of the database, the problems of data redundancy and inconsistency are controlled.</td>
    <td>In this, the files and application programs are created by different programmers so that there exists a lot of duplication of data which may lead to inconsistency.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Structure</strong></td>
    <td>The database structure is complex to design.</td>
    <td>The file system approach has a simple structure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Integrity Constraints</strong></td>
    <td>Integrity Constraints are easy to apply.</td>
    <td>Integrity Constraints are difficult to implement in file system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Flexibility</strong> </td>
    <td>Changes are often a necessity to the content of the data stored in any system, and these changes are more easily with a database approach.</td>
    <td>The flexibility of the system is less as compared to the DBMS approach.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Examples</strong></td>
    <td>Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase etc.</td>
    <td>Cobol, C++ etc.</td>
