    <h2>WELCOME TO CODING CRUSH</h2>
   <h3>SUBQUERY</h3>
<p> <b>Subquery/Nested query:</b>
    Nested query is a query within another query. SQL has an ability to nest queries within one another.A subquery 
    in MySQL is a query, which is nested into another SQL query and embedded with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE 
    statement along with the various operators. We can also nest the subquery with another subquery. A subquery is 
    known as the inner query, and the query that contains subquery is known as the outer query.
    <br> The inner query executed first gives the result to the outer query, and then the main/outer query will be performed. MySQL allows us to use
      subquery anywhere, but it must be closed within parenthesis. All subquery forms and operations supported by the SQL standard will be supported in MySQL also.
</p>
<p> The following are the rules to use subqueries:</p>
<ul>
<li> Subqueries should always use in parentheses.</li>
 <li> If the main query does not have multiple columns for subquery, then a subquery can have only one column in the SELECT command.</li>
<li> We can use various comparison operators with the subquery, such as >, <, =, IN, ANY, SOME, and ALL. A multiple-row operator is very useful when the subquery returns more than one row. </li>
<li> We cannot use the ORDER BY clause in a subquery, although it can be used inside the main query. I</li>
<li> If we use a subquery in a set function, it cannot be immediately enclosed in a set function. </li>
<br>
<h3>Syntax:</h3>
<p class="back"> SELECT column_list (s) FROM  table_name  
    WHERE  column_name OPERATOR  
       (SELECT column_list (s)  FROM table_name [WHERE])  </p>
   <br>
